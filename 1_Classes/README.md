# Intro
Each class in AL has their benefit. Depending on the type of content you are doing, you will likely want to bring a different set of characters into the fray.

## Mage
Possibly the most versatile class in the game. It provides the best mobility in the game, while also being a solid source for dishing out damage.

### Uses
  - When moving around the map frequently is neccesarry, you will want a mage in your party. Using blink & magiport will let you travel very fast, and summon your allies where you need to be.
  - Having a mage provides extra gold via the alchemy skill, rather than selling items to a vendor.

## Ranger
This class is in a unique position. It simply lacks the damage/utility to be viable in most forms of content. However, ranger does excel at some things.

### Uses
  - 3-shot & 5-shot give the ranger the ability to attack a lot of enemies at once. By carefully choosing the targets you can kill with 1 hit, 3-shot will let you kill three things at once. This is very useful in farming low tier enemies en masse.
  - Hunter's Mark is a good buff to have for single target fights with a lot of people (event bosses). However, being only a 10% buff, It's not enough of a reason to bring the ranger to single target fights over other classes

## Warrior
The warrior is a solid class to have in almost any roster. It has, generally, the highest raw damage output in the game.

### Uses
  - Any single target fight where the health of the target is not high enough for rogue to overtake in damage due to their stacking buff.
  - AoE fights with enemies that have a significant amount of health (`fireroamers` or `plantoid`). This is due to the weaponry that warriors can use, which give them `explosion`. These weapons include: `ololipop`, `glolipop`, and `vhammer`.
  - Tanking enemies with physical damage. The warrior has `hardshell`, which grants them a significant amount of armor. They also have a high base `courage` value, which allows them to not get frightened when fighting a hoard of physical damage enemies.

## Priest
The priest is the healer of the party. They also function as the best magic damage enemy tank. 

### Uses
  - Any fight where you will be attacked by a lot of magic type damage. The priest has a high `mcourage` stat, letting them avoid frightened.
  - A fight where you want a high amount of `luck`. Priests can equip both `lunarmace` and `mshield`, which provide luck for boosting drops.
  
## Rogue
Rogue is the best class when it comes to high health enemies, such as event bosses. Their damage stacking passive provides a massive boost of damage to all other rogues.

### Uses
  - `franky`, `icegolem`, `m1`, `mrpumpkin`, `mrgreen`, `grinch`, `xmagex`
